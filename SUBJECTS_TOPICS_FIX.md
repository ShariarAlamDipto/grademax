# Subjects and Topics Loading Fix

## Issue
Subjects and topics were not showing in the worksheet generator, even though the database had the data.

## Root Cause
The API routes were trying to query database columns that didn't exist:
- `subjects` table: API was selecting `color` column, but database has `board` instead
- `topics` table: API was selecting `spec_ref` column, but database has `description` instead

## Database Schema (Actual)

### subjects table
```
- id (uuid)
- code (text)
- name (text)
- board (text)  ← Was trying to select 'color'
- level (text)
- created_at (timestamp)
```

### topics table
```
- id (uuid)
- subject_id (uuid)
- code (text)
- name (text)
- description (text)  ← Was trying to select 'spec_ref'
- keywords (text)
- formulas (text)
- created_at (timestamp)
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed `/api/subjects/route.ts`
```typescript
// Before
.select('id, name, code, level, color')

// After
.select('id, name, code, level, board')
```

### 2. Fixed `/api/topics/route.ts`
```typescript
// Before
.select('id, name, code, spec_ref')

// After
.select('id, name, code, description')
```

### 3. Updated TypeScript Interfaces in `generate/page.tsx`
```typescript
interface Subject {
  id: string;
  code: string;
  name: string;
  level?: string;
  board?: string;  // Changed from color
}

interface Topic {
  id: string;
  code: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;  // Changed from spec_ref
}
```

### 4. Removed Authentication System
- Removed permission state variables
- Removed permission check useEffect
- Removed all permission UI blocks
- Made worksheet generator open access (no login required)

## Testing Results

### Local Testing (✅ Success)
```
Subjects API: Returning 2 subjects
Topics API: Returning 10 topics for subject 8dea5d70-f026-4e03-bb45-053f154c6898
```

### Subjects Returned
1. Physics (4PH1)
2. Further Pure Mathematics (4FM1)

### Topics for Further Pure Mathematics (10 topics)
1. Logarithmic functions & indices
2. Quadratic function
3. Identities & inequalities
4. Graphs
5. Series (AP/GP, sums, limits)
6. Binomial series
7. Scalar & vector quantities
8. Rectangular Cartesian coordinates
9. Calculus
10. Trigonometry

## Deployment Status

### Ready for Production ✅
- All APIs tested and working locally
- Database schema matches API queries
- No compilation errors
- Authentication removed (open access)

### Before Deploying to Vercel
Make sure these environment variables are set in Vercel:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

(Note: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is optional and only needed for admin operations)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Test on Production**
   - Visit: https://www.grademax.me/generate
   - Verify subjects show up immediately
   - Select "Further Pure Mathematics"
   - Verify 10 topics display correctly

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - Re-ingest questions with better topic classification
   - Add more subjects and topics
   - Implement proper worksheet PDF generation
