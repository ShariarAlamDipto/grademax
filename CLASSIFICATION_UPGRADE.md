Successfully upgraded the Physics classification system from basic keyword matching to an advanced **v2.2 specification** with hybrid multi-pass classification.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Completed

### 1. **Hybrid Multi-Pass Classification System**

Created 3-tier classification pipeline:

- **Pass 1: Gemini 2.0 Flash** - Bulk classification (20 q/batch, 1500 RPM)
- **Pass 2: Groq Llama** - Refine low confidence (<0.70)
- **Pass 3: Enhanced Keywords v2.2** - Smart fallback with weighted scoring

### 2. **Enhanced Keyword Library (v2.2)**

Upgraded from basic keywords to comprehensive Physics specification:

#### **New Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Formula recognition** (e.g., `v = fŒª`, `F = ma`, `p = œÅgh`)
- ‚úÖ **Weighted scoring** (5 = highly specific, 2 = general)
- ‚úÖ **Negative keywords** to avoid false positives
- ‚úÖ **Multi-phrase matching** (e.g., "electromagnetic spectrum", "total internal reflection")
- ‚úÖ **Symbol normalization** (Greek letters, math operators)

#### **Coverage by Topic:**

**Topic 1: Forces & Motion**
- Core: SUVAT equations, Newton's laws, momentum/impulse
- 20+ keywords including: `v = u + at`, `F=ma`, `p = mv`, `terminal velocity`

**Topic 8: Astrophysics**
- Core: Orbits, redshift, Big Bang

### 3. **Confidence Scoring Enhancement**

New confidence calculation includes:
- Base score from keyword weight (max 0.5 for keywords)
- Boost for clear winners (best >> second best)
- Penalty for negative keyword presence
- LLM classifications get 0.8-1.0 confidence

## üÜï New Features in v2.2

### **1. Symbol Grammar Normalization**
```python
# Automatically converts:
Œª ‚Üí lambda
Œ∏ ‚Üí theta
√ó ‚Üí *
‚àí ‚Üí -
```

### **2. Layout Signal Detection**
```python
# Recognizes diagrams/contexts:
- Circuit diagrams (ammeter, voltmeter symbols)
- Ray diagrams (principal focus, focal length)
- Kinematics graphs (velocity-time, distance-time)
- Transformer diagrams (primary coil, iron core)
```

### **3. Negative Keyword Filtering**
```python
# Avoids false positives:
"current affairs" ‚Üí Don't tag as Electricity
"radio button" ‚Üí Don't tag as Nuclear
"power of attorney" ‚Üí Don't tag as Energy
"pressure group" ‚Üí Don't tag as Matter
"waves goodbye" ‚Üí Don't tag as Waves
```

### **4. Precedence Rules**
```python
# Smart disambiguation:
- Prefer ELEC over MAG when circuits present
- Prefer WAVES over MOTION when optics present
- Prefer RADIO over SPACE when radioactivity present
```
