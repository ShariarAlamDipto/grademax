### ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Login Error: "requested path is invalid"
- **Issue**: Login with Gmail fails with path error
- **Likely Cause**: Redirect URL mismatch in Supabase Auth settings
- **Fix**: Need to configure Supabase (see instructions below)

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Fix Process

### Step 1: Run Updated Database Script

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project: `tybaetnvnfgniotdfxze`

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "+ New query"

3. **Run COMPLETE_FIX.sql**
   - Open `c:\Users\shari\grademax\COMPLETE_FIX.sql` in VS Code
   - Copy ALL contents (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click "RUN" button
   - **Wait for success message** showing:
     ```
     ‚úÖ Complete database fix applied successfully!
     ‚úÖ Inserted 24 Physics topics successfully!
     ```

### Step 2: Fix Supabase Authentication URLs

**This fixes the "requested path is invalid" error**

1. **Go to Authentication Settings**
   - In Supabase Dashboard, click "Authentication" ‚Üí "URL Configuration"

2. **Set Site URL**
   ```
   Site URL: http://localhost:3001
   ```

3. **Add Redirect URLs**
   Add BOTH of these URLs:
   ```
   http://localhost:3001/auth/callback
   http://localhost:3001/**
   ```

4. **Save Changes**
   - Click "Save" at the bottom
   - Wait for confirmation

### Step 3: Clear Browser and Test

1. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
   - Select "Cached images and files"
   - Select "Cookies and site data"
   - Click "Clear data"

2. **Restart Dev Server** (if needed)
   ```powershell
   # In VS Code terminal:
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop server
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Login**
   - Go to: http://localhost:3001/login
   - Click "Sign in with Google"
   - Should redirect properly to dashboard
   - Profile should auto-create

4. **Test Worksheets Page**
   - Go to: http://localhost:3001/worksheets
   - **Verify**: Dark background, white text
   - Select "Edexcel IGCSE Physics (4PH1)"
   - **Verify**: 24 topics appear in dropdown
   - Topics should include: Units, Movement and position, Forces, Electricity, Waves, etc.

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

After completing the steps above, verify:

- [ ] **Dark Theme**: Worksheets page has black background with white text
- [ ] **Subjects Dropdown**: Shows 20 subjects (Edexcel, Cambridge IGCSE)
- [ ] **Physics Topics**: Shows 24 topics when Physics 4PH1 is selected
- [ ] **Login Works**: No "requested path is invalid" error
- [ ] **Profile Created**: User profile exists in database
- [ ] **No Console Errors**: Check browser DevTools (F12) for errors

## üéØ Testing Physics Worksheet Generation

Once everything is working:

1. **Go to Worksheets Page**
   - http://localhost:3001/worksheets

2. **Select Physics**
   - Subject: "Edexcel IGCSE Physics (4PH1)"
   - Wait for topics to load (should show 24 topics)

3. **Select Topics** (optional)
   - Choose specific topics like "Forces, movement, shape and momentum"
   - Or leave empty for all topics

4. **Set Parameters**
   - Difficulty: Easy / Medium / Hard (choose any)
   - Number of Questions: 10
   - Include markscheme: ‚úì (optional)

5. **Generate**
   - Click "Generate Worksheet"
   - Should generate questions from selected Physics topics

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If topics still don't show:

1. **Check database**
   - In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM topics WHERE subject_id IN (
     SELECT id FROM subjects WHERE code = '4PH1'
   );
   ```
   - Should return 24

2. **Check API response**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Network tab
   - Select Physics subject
   - Look for `/api/topics?subjectId=...` request
   - Should return array with 24 items

### If login still fails:

1. **Check environment variables**
   - Open `.env.local`
   - Verify these match Supabase dashboard:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://tybaetnvnfgniotdfxze.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
   ```

2. **Check Google OAuth is enabled**
   - Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Providers
   - Google should be "Enabled"
   - Client ID and Secret should be filled

3. **Check auth callback code**
   - File is at: `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts`
   - Code looks correct already

### If dark theme doesn't work:

1. **Hard refresh page**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (force reload)
   
2. **Check build**
   - In terminal, should show:
   ```
   ‚úì Compiled /worksheets
   ```

## üìù What Changed

### Files Modified:

1. **`src/app/worksheets/page.tsx`**
   - Changed: `bg-gray-50` ‚Üí `bg-black`
   - Changed: `text-gray-900` ‚Üí `text-white`
   - Changed: `bg-white` cards ‚Üí `bg-white/5 border border-white/10`
   - Changed: All text colors to white/light variants
   - Changed: Error messages to red with dark theme
   - Changed: Difficulty badges to dark theme
   - Changed: Markscheme details to dark theme

2. **`COMPLETE_FIX.sql`**
   - Added: Physics topics seed (24 topics)
   - Added: Instructions for fixing login redirect URLs
   - Added: Better success messages

### What Didn't Change:

- Database schema (already correct)
- API endpoints (already working)
- Auth callback code (already correct)
- Test files (already passing)

## üéâ Next Steps After Physics Works

Once Physics is working perfectly:

1. **Add more subjects' topics**
   - Create similar seed files for:
     - Chemistry (4CH1)
     - Math (4MA1)
     - Biology (4BI1)
     - etc.

2. **Ingest past papers**
   - Use the ingestion modules in `ingest/` folder
   - Process PDF papers to extract questions

3. **Build more features**
   - Save worksheets to database
   - Share worksheets with students
   - Track progress and performance

---

## üìû Support

If you're still having issues after following these steps:

1. Check terminal for compilation errors
2. Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
3. Check Supabase logs for database errors
4. Verify all environment variables are correct

**Remember**: Physics should work first before moving to other subjects!

## Summary

‚úÖ **Fixed**: Dark theme for worksheets
‚úÖ **Fixed**: Added 24 Physics topics to database
‚ö†Ô∏è **Action Required**: Configure Supabase redirect URLs for login

Run `COMPLETE_FIX.sql` ‚Üí Configure Auth URLs ‚Üí Clear cache ‚Üí Test! üöÄ
