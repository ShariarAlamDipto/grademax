3. ✅ Trigger Vercel auto-deploy
4. ✅ Show you next steps

---

### Option 2: **Manual Deploy** (Traditional)

```powershell

npm run build

# 2. Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# 3. Vercel will automatically deploy!
```

Then go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Environment Variables

After deploying, **CHECK** that these are set in Vercel:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on **grademax** project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Verify these exist:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = https://tybaetnvnfgniotdfxze.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = eyJhbGc...BAYes
   ```

5. If missing, add them and **redeploy**
